/* Shashank likes strings in which consecutive characters are different. For example, he likes ABABA, while he doesn't like ABAA. Given a string containing characters  and  only, he wants to change it into a string he likes. To do this, he is allowed to delete the characters in the string.

Your task is to find the minimum number of required deletions.
 Sample Input
 
 5
 AAAA
 BBBBB
 ABABABAB
 BABABA
 AAABBB
 Sample Output
 
 3
 4
 0
 0
 4
 Explanation
 
 AAAA  A, 3 deletions
 BBBBB  B, 4 deletions
 ABABABAB  ABABABAB, 0 deletions
 BABABA  BABABA, 0 deletions
 AAABBB  AB, 4 deletions because to convert it to AB we need to delete 2 A's and 2 B's
